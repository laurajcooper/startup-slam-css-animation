# Exploring Animation with CSS3

Have you ever come across a website with a super awesome effect and wondered how they did that? Many of these effects are actually created using only CSS3!

CSS is critical for determining the way a website should look, and though basic styling with CSS has been around for many years now, there were a ton of features introduced in CSS3 that many developers aren’t even aware of! One of these features is the ability to add animation to HTML elements such as text, buttons, and images. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to utilize CSS3 to add incredible effects to your website to make it unique, dynamic and engaging.

You will get the most out of this workshop if you have at least a small amount of prior experience with basic CSS, but this is not absolutely necessary.
